# Associations

When mapping a JPA entity, besides the underlying table columns, the application developer can map entity relationships
either in one direction or in a bidirectional way. This is another impedance mismatch between the object-oriented Domain
Model and relational database system because, when using an ORM tool, the parent and the child-side can reference each
other.

Associations describe how two or more entities form a relationship based on a database joining semantics.
